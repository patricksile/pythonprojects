## Project1: Music Break Project


> Do you know a friend who works too many hours? We will write a program that schedules
breaks throughout the day -- reminding your friend to listen to his favorite music in 
the web browser, get up and dance to it or just walk away from the computer if he wants to, 
then go back to work when his favorite music finishes to play.

## Project2: Secret message

>My friends and I, we play a lot of pranks
on each other. Today, however, I was on
the receiving end of one. This morning, I
could not find my house keys. Just then,
I got a text message from a friend. We
have hidden your house keys, said the
text message. To find them, you have to
solve a puzzle. On your computer there
is a folder with several photos. (See photos here) If you
rename all the files by removing the
numbers from the photo name, the
photos will reveal a secret message and
lead you to the house key.
This renaming of 50 files will take a long time. I can't wait to solve this puzzle so I
can get my keys back.

>Secret Message (Output)
So, here I have a folder on my computer with a bunch of photos. Now, you'll notice
that the message in these photos is all jumbled up, we can't quite read it just yet.
Now, if I zoom into these photos, you'll notice that the names of the photos, they
have numbers in them.

>And it's our task to remove those numbers. And I wrote a program that does just
that. Let me run it. The output window shows all of the files that were renamed
and if I look at the folders again, you'll notice that the photos have been renamed.
Their names don't have any numbers in them anymore.
Also, if I zoom out just a little bit. You'll notice that the photos are now revealing a
message. Which in this case is just, SOME SECRET MESSAGE. Let's build this
Program.
