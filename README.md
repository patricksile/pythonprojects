## Project1: Music Break Project


Do you know a friend who works too many hours? We will write a program that schedules
breaks throughout the day -- reminding your friend to listen to his favorite music in 
the web browser, get up and dance to it or just walk away from the computer if he wants to, 
then go back to work when his favorite music finishes to play.




Steps to solve the problem:

Romy's Steps:
1 - Put all together what is needed to program the music break through the day.
2 - write the program.
3 - Try if the program works.


Patrick's Steps:

1 - Open a web browser and play a music (webbrowser.open(url_of_the_music))
2 - Delay (Working period) (time.sleep(secs))
2 - Repeat step 1 and 2 as much as needed.
